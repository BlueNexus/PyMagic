# Committing Cards
In order to commit new cards, make a fork of this repository, and add the new cards on seperate lines in the monsterList.csv
file. Monsters follow this format:

"Name", cost, power, defence, "ability", unique id (starts from AA, then AB, then AC... AZ, then BA, BB, BC, et cetera)

So an example monster would be 

"Black_Boa", 2, 2, 1, "First Strike", AA

following the format:
    Name     C  P  D     Ability      I
