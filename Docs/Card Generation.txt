Card Generation
###################

In PyMagic, Card generation occurs through one of two methods, both of while will be explained in this document.
The first method involves randomly generating a set of cards when the application is run, and the second involves
importing a premade list of cards.

Choosing a method
------------------
Whenever you run PyMagic, you will be presented with a choice between the CardGenerator, and premade cards. In order to select
premade cards, type "Premade". In order to select randomly generated cards, select "Random". 

Random card generation
------------------
When a cardlist is generated at random, the CardGen will import names and abilities from the nameList.csv and abilityList.csv files 
respectively. Using these names and abilities, the generator will then create a specified number of cards, randomly choosing their power,
defence, cost, name and ability, the latter two being chosen from the imported lists. The maximum power and defence of a card
is configurable in the config. 

Card cost is chosen with the equation Cost = ((power + defence) / B) + (ability cost / B). As such, more expensive abilities will result in
a more expensive card, as will higher totals of power and defence. The "B" shown in the equation stands for the Balancer, which can be changed
in the config. By default, this is set to 2. 

Once the specified number of cards are generated, the program will then save the cards to cardList.csv for later use.

Loading cards
------------------
Whenever you start up the game, the card list will be imported for use in deck generation. If you chose to use premade cards earlier,
the cards in the premadeList.csv file will be loaded, following the template: Name, cost, power, defence, ability, ID. If you chose to use
random cards, then the card list will be loaded from the cardList.csv file using the same template.

Each deck will then be generated by randomly picking 60 cards from the chosen list. Depending on the length of the list, this can result in
duplicates in a deck, which will be especially common if there are less than 60 cards total in the list.
